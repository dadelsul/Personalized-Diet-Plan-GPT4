# 🍏 Personalized Diet Plan using GPT-4 Fine-Tuning

This project introduces an **AI-powered system** that generates personalized diet plans for patients with **multiple chronic conditions** (e.g., diabetes + hypertension + obesity). Unlike traditional systems that focus on a single disease, this solution provides **clinically relevant and adaptable** diet recommendations tailored to real-world healthcare needs.

## 🚀 Features
- Fine-tuned **GPT-4** model on custom healthcare and nutrition data.
- Supports **multiple conditions simultaneously**.
- Generates **nutritionally balanced** meal plans.
- Provides **fitness guidance** alongside diet recommendations.
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time use.
